Creating a better Coursicle alternative for USF students to compensate for the horrid registration system.

After being fed up with the majority of my classes not having waitlists, I decided to make my own program to send emails to 
the user when a specified class has seats open.

This could be seen as an alternative to Coursicle for USF students. This program is lightweight and requires no other software to be installed to 
send an email notification.

Users that wish to be notified of a class opening will need to provide an email that will be used when a class opening is detected. 

Emails are only stored locally, no other information is stored so the user's privacy is not compromised.
