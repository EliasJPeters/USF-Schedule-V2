# USF-Schedule-V2
Creating a better Coursicle alternative for USF students to compensate for the horrid registration system.

UPDATE - 2/1/23
	

Unfortunately, I am not uploading updated versions of this code due to potential monetization I can apply to it in the future. Since the last commit, this software has helped me get into 2 of my classes that were full and 2 of my friends get into theirs. Everything works and performance is great. I've been looking and working on migrating the software to a web application to make it more convienent and easy to use.

About:

After being fed up with the majority of my classes not having waitlists, I decided to make my own program to send emails to 
the user when a specified class has seats open.

This could be seen as an alternative to Coursicle for USF students. This program is lightweight and requires no other software to be installed to 
send an email notification. A dedicated web server is in the works to offload the process onto the web for anyone to use with no required downloads.

Users that wish to be notified of a class opening will need to provide an email that will be used when a class opening is detected. 

Emails are only stored locally, no other information is stored so the user's privacy is not compromised.
